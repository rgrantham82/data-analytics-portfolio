**Categories (originally available for filtering):**  
- All
- SQL
- Machine Learning
- AI
- Forecasting
- Clustering
- Data Visualization
- Predictive Analytics
- Credit Risk
- Crime Analysis

*(Note: Without interactive filters, treat these categories as references. You can manually scan for relevant tags in each project.)*
